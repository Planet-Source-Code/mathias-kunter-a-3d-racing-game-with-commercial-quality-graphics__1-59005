*************************ABOUT REVO TRON*************************
The basic game idea of the Tron lightcycle game is that you drive a
fast futuristic bike, called lightcycle. It leaves a wall where it goes,
so the arena turns into a labyrinth after some time. The goal is to
force the enemies to hit a wall while you should try to avoid this for
yourself, of course. The last player alive is the winner.
REVO TRON also invented a new game mode: the action mode. If it's
switched on, you can use speedups, different weapons and shields. You'll
get an item after some time which is displayed at the top-right corner of
your screen. You can use this item then by pressing the space key.
The action mode makes a Tron game become a real action battle!
